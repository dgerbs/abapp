					We have a number of products that we're developing which are designed to decrease wasted time, effort, and money, and increase efficiency, productivity, and cost-effective savings. Tacky, I know. I'm writing this late at night with zero brain power.
					<br /><br />
					Our flagship product is Bind. Through a simple rating and feedback system, users can determine the quality of any given commercially manufactured antibody with user-generated, testable protocols. This raises the standard of antibodies available on the market today.
					It's Amazon for antibody research.
